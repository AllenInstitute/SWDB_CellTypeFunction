# SWDB Cell Types and Function

This repository covers concepts about exploring cell types and function using the MICrONS explorer dataset.

Workshop 1 covers unsupervised clustering techniques on high dimensional features to define cell types.

Workshop 2 explores how functional correlation distributions change when looking between neurons of different cell types, 
versus neurons that are synaptically connected.
