This is the repository for the Cell Types and Function tutorial for the 2023 Summer Workshop on the Dynamic Brain.

This repository covers concepts about exploring cell types and function using the MICrONS explorer dataset.

Workshop 1 covers unsupervised clustering techniques on high dimensional features to define cell types.

Workshop 2 explores how functional correlation distributions change when looking between neurons of different cell types, 
versus neurons that are synaptically connected. 

# Support Policy

We are releasing this code as part of the 2023 Summer Workshop on the Dynamic Brain and will only be supporting and developing it for the context of this workshop. The community is welcome to submit issues, but you should not expect an active response outside of the context of the course.
