RUN THIS ONCE PER COMPUTER YOU ARE SETTING UP !!!\n\nThe Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine (CAVE) supports several large scale EM datasets, and has an authentication system that regulates access to the webservices and datasets. In order to connect to the servers you have to authenticate to tell the server who you are.  \n\nWhen accessing the servers programatically this is done by passing a token that validates who you are.\nThe server has a copy of this token, it's like a password, but the server makes it for you.\n\nYou can tell the server to make a new token for you.\n\nYou can tell the server to list the token it has for you.\n\nThe token is a string of letters and numbers like \"ecc4casd1f70f254dwad452524bd0d0d8\" (but that one is made up)\n\nIf you are using codeocean, you need to setup a secret with that token and configure your capsule to load that secret as an environment variable. \n\nIf you are using your own computer you need to save this token to a file on your computer so that the caveclient can read it and pass it onto the server when interacting with it to tell it who you are.  You can't do this with codeocean because each time your run a capsule its a new computer.\n\nThe CAVEclient has methods that help you do all these things, but note you might want to do different things depending on what you are trying to do.  This notebook will break down those scenarios and you can follow the one most appropriate to what you are trying to do."},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cd528f5a","metadata":{},"source":"### Scenario 1: Completely new user\n\nYou have never interacted with CAVE before, you don't think you have an account, and have never setup a computer before with CAVE.\n\nIn this case you want to.\n1.
